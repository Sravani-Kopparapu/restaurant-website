# restaurant-website
🍽✨ SAREGAMA SPICES — where flavors meet pixels! What started as a spark of curiosity turned into a full restaurant website concept in just one day. No frameworks, no shortcuts — just pure HTML and CSS magic, shaping every section from scratch. This project focuses entirely on the web page design, capturing the look and feel of a real restaurant’s online presence.
